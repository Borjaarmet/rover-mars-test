        <h1>Mars Rover Mission</h1>
        <h2>Your Task</h2>
        <p>
          Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely
          controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet. Develop a software
          that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are
          understood by the rover.
        </p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the
            direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
          </li>
          <li>The rover receives a collection of commands. (E.g.) FFRRFFFRL</li>
          <li>The rover can move forward (f).</li>
          <li>The rover can move left/right (l,r).</li>
          <li>
            Suppose we are on a really weird planet that is square. 200x200 for
            example :)
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a
            given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves
            up to the last possible point, aborts the sequence and reports the
            obstacle.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Take into account</h2>
        <p>Rovers are expensive, make sure the software works as expected.</p>
